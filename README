CS3307 group project stage 3
Group 3 
Project name: Droplet

For this stage of the group project, we implemented almost all of our required user stories. 
The Status and Resets user stories have been fully implemented, and the Taring story is partially complete. 
This is the equivalent of 2.5/7 (35%) of our user stories, or 13/28 story points (45%) 

User story 1) Status
The program reads in data from the dummy scale and updates the status every "hour" (simulated hour).
In the future we would like this check to be done constantly, or at least more frequently than hourly.
With all 3 status lights & the final celebration lights working, all acceptance tests have been passed for this user story.

User story 2) Resets
All working, with completed acceptance tests.

User story 2) Taring. 
Due to the roadblocks hit while building the scale, this stage does not have that hardware but reads a text file which simulates the readings that would come in from a scale (in grams). 
The text file is formatted as such: each line is a reading, with the first being the empty bottle (used for taring). 
The remaining values are the readings from the scale as would be read in every hour, for 15 hours (the number of hours this test case is awake for)
There is currently no button for taring; nor is there a full scale. That is why this user story is considered only 1/2 complete.

/////*****THE TEST CASE*****/////
In this test case, we simulate a user who has a goal of 2L, stays awake for 15 hours in their day, and is not very good at staying on track.
The text file is formatted as described above, and acts like a scale (simply contains weight values to be read)
At the end the user still passes their goal; to test what happens if they do not, change the final two values in the file to be > 300.

Future steps: 
- accounting for the case where the user refills their water bottle
- completing the scale
- adding a tare button 
- remaining user stories

How to run: make default
